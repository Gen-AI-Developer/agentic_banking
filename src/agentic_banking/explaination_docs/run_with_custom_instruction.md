## Study Notes: `AgentRunner` and Related Code

### Overview
The code defines an `AgentRunner` class and supporting components to execute workflows involving AI agents. These agents process inputs, interact with models (e.g., LLMs), apply tools, handle handoffs to other agents, and enforce guardrails for input/output validation. The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution, as well as streaming results for real-time interaction. It is designed to be modular, extensible, and traceable, with features like session management and lifecycle hooks.

### Key Components
1. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - **What**: The code imports various Python standard libraries (`asyncio`, `copy`, `inspect`), third-party libraries (`openai.types.responses`), and custom modules (e.g., `_run_impl`, `agent`, `guardrail`).
   - **Why**: These imports provide asynchronous programming support, type annotations, data structures, and integration with external AI models (e.g., OpenAI). Custom modules handle agent logic, guardrails, and tracing.
   - **How**: The `from __future__ import annotations` enables forward type references for better type hinting. Libraries like `dataclasses` and `typing` ensure robust data modeling and type safety.
   - **Where**: Used throughout the codebase to define classes, handle async operations, and integrate with external APIs.
   - **When**: Imported at the module level, available globally during execution.

2. **RunConfig (Dataclass)**:
   - **What**: A `dataclass` that configures settings for an agent run, such as the model, provider, guardrails, and tracing options.
   - **Why**: Centralizes configuration for agent runs, allowing customization of model behavior, input/output validation, and tracing.
   - **How**: Defines fields like `model`, `model_provider`, `input_guardrails`, and `tracing_disabled` with defaults. For example, `model_provider` defaults to `MultiProvider`, and `tracing_disabled` defaults to `False`.
   - **Where**: Used as an argument to `AgentRunner.run` and related methods to configure the workflow.
   - **When**: Instantiated when starting a run, typically passed via `run_config` in `RunOptions`.

   **Key Fields**:
   - `model`: Specifies the AI model (string or `Model` object) to use.
   - `model_provider`: Resolves model names to actual models (defaults to `MultiProvider`).
   - `input_guardrails`/`output_guardrails`: Lists of guardrails to validate inputs/outputs.
   - `tracing_disabled`: Controls whether tracing is enabled.
   - `workflow_name`: A logical name for the run (e.g., "Customer support agent").

3. **RunOptions (TypedDict)**:
   - **What**: A `TypedDict` defining optional arguments for `AgentRunner` methods.
   - **Why**: Provides a structured way to pass parameters like `context`, `max_turns`, and `hooks` to run methods.
   - **How**: Uses `NotRequired` from `typing_extensions` to mark fields as optional. Generic typing (`TContext`) supports flexible context types.
   - **Where**: Used in `run`, `run_sync`, and `run_streamed` methods to pass configuration.
   - **When**: Provided by the caller when initiating an agent run.

4. **Runner Class**:
   - **What**: A base class with class methods (`run`, `run_sync`, `run_streamed`) that delegate to the `AgentRunner` instance.
   - **Why**: Provides a high-level interface for running agents, abstracting the underlying `AgentRunner` implementation.
   - **How**: Each method calls the corresponding method on `DEFAULT_AGENT_RUNNER`, a global `AgentRunner` instance.
   - **Where**: Used as the primary entry point for external code to invoke agent workflows.
   - **When**: Called when initiating an agent run, typically from application code.

   **Methods**:
   - `run`: Async method to run an agent workflow until completion, returning a `RunResult`.
   - `run_sync`: Synchronous wrapper around `run`, using `asyncio.run_until_complete`.
   - `run_streamed`: Runs the workflow in streaming mode, returning a `RunResultStreaming` object for real-time event streaming.

5. **AgentRunner Class**:
   - **What**: The core class responsible for executing agent workflows, managing turns, guardrails, tools, and handoffs.
   - **Why**: Orchestrates the agent lifecycle, ensuring inputs are processed, models are invoked, tools are executed, and outputs are validated.
   - **How**: Implements an event loop that runs agents until a final output is produced or an error occurs. Supports async (`run`), sync (`run_sync`), and streaming (`run_streamed`) modes.
   - **Where**: Used internally by the `Runner` class and as the default runner (`DEFAULT_AGENT_RUNNER`).
   - **When**: Instantiated as a singleton (`DEFAULT_AGENT_RUNNER`) and used whenever an agent workflow is executed.

   **Key Methods**:
   - `run`: Executes the agent workflow asynchronously, handling input preparation, guardrails, model responses, and handoffs.
   - `run_sync`: Synchronous version of `run`, suitable for non-async contexts (e.g., scripts, but not Jupyter or FastAPI).
   - `run_streamed`: Executes the workflow in streaming mode, emitting events (e.g., `AgentUpdatedStreamEvent`, `RawResponsesStreamEvent`) as they occur.
   - Helper methods like `_run_single_turn`, `_run_input_guardrails`, and `_get_new_response` handle specific tasks within the workflow.

6. **Workflow Loop**:
   - **What**: The core logic of `AgentRunner.run` and `run_streamed`, which runs an agent in a loop until a final output or error.
   - **Why**: Ensures agents process inputs, execute tools, handle handoffs, and produce outputs within a defined number of turns (`max_turns`).
   - **How**:
     1. Initializes tracing, input preparation, and tool tracking.
     2. Runs input guardrails (only on the first turn).
     3. Invokes the agent to get a model response.
     4. Processes the response (e.g., tool calls, handoffs, or final output).
     5. Repeats until a final output is produced or `max_turns` is exceeded.
   - **Where**: Implemented in `AgentRunner.run` and `AgentRunner._start_streaming`.
   - **When**: Executed during `run` or `run_streamed` calls, triggered by user input.

7. **Guardrails**:
   - **What**: Input and output guardrails (`InputGuardrail`, `OutputGuardrail`) validate inputs and outputs to ensure safety and correctness.
   - **Why**: Prevents invalid or harmful inputs/outputs from proceeding, enhancing system reliability.
   - **How**: Guardrails are run asynchronously, and if a tripwire is triggered, an exception (`InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` or `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`) is raised.
   - **Where**: Applied in `_run_input_guardrails` (first turn) and `_run_output_guardrails` (final output).
   - **When**: Input guardrails run at the start of the first turn; output guardrails run when a final output is produced.

8. **Handoffs**:
   - **What**: Mechanisms to transfer control to another agent (`Handoff` objects).
   - **Why**: Enables modular workflows where one agent can delegate to another based on the task.
   - **How**: Handoffs are checked after each turn (`NextStepHandoff`). The new agent is loaded, and the loop continues.
   - **Where**: Managed in `_get_handoffs` and processed in the main loop.
   - **When**: Triggered when an agent’s response indicates a handoff.

9. **Tools**:
   - **What**: `Tool` objects that agents can use to perform actions (e.g., API calls, calculations).
   - **Why**: Extends agent capabilities beyond text generation, enabling interaction with external systems.
   - **How**: Tools are retrieved via `_get_all_tools` and executed in `_get_single_step_result_from_response`.
   - **Where**: Integrated into the model response processing pipeline.
   - **When**: Executed when a model response includes tool calls.

10. **Tracing**:
    - **What**: A system for logging and monitoring agent execution (`TraceCtxManager`, `Span`).
    - **Why**: Provides visibility into the workflow for debugging and performance analysis.
    - **How**: Uses `agent_span` to create spans for each agent turn, with options to include sensitive data (`trace_include_sensitive_data`).
    - **Where**: Enabled in `run` and `run_streamed` via `TraceCtxManager`.
    - **When**: Active throughout the workflow unless `tracing_disabled` is set.

11. **Session Management**:
    - **What**: A `Session` object for storing conversation history.
    - **Why**: Enables persistence of conversation context across runs.
    - **How**: Inputs and results are combined with session history in `_prepare_input_with_session` and saved in `_save_result_to_session`.
    - **Where**: Used when a `session` is provided in `RunOptions`.
    - **When**: Applied before and after the workflow loop.

### Key Concepts for Learning

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - The code heavily uses `asyncio` for non-blocking execution, critical for handling model responses and guardrail checks concurrently.
   - Methods like `asyncio.gather` and `asyncio.as_completed` optimize parallel task execution.

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Uses `typing`, `typing_extensions`, and generics (`Generic[TContext]`) to ensure type correctness.
   - `NotRequired` in `RunOptions` allows flexible argument passing.

3. **Modularity**:
   - Separates concerns into classes (`Agent`, `RunConfig`, `RunHooks`) and helper methods (`_run_single_turn`, `_get_new_response`).
   - Supports extensibility via hooks, guardrails, and custom models.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Custom exceptions (`MaxTurnsExceeded`, `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`) provide clear error reporting.
   - Tracing integrates error details into spans for debugging.

5. **Streaming**:
   - `run_streamed` and `_run_single_turn_streamed` enable real-time event emission, crucial for interactive applications.
   - Uses queues (`_event_queue`) to manage event streaming.
