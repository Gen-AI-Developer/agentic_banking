## Study Notes: OpenAI Agents SDK Tracing

### Overview of Tracing
- **What**: Tracing in the OpenAI Agents SDK is a mechanism to record and monitor the sequence of events during an agent’s workflow execution. It captures details such as LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrails, and custom events.
- **Why**: Tracing is essential for debugging, visualizing, and monitoring workflows during development and production, ensuring developers can track performance, identify errors, and optimize agent behavior.
- **How**: Tracing is enabled by default and collects events in the form of **traces** (end-to-end workflows) and **spans** (individual operations within a trace). The **Traces dashboard** provides a visual interface to analyze these events.
- **Where**: Tracing is integrated into the SDK’s runtime environment and can be exported to the OpenAI backend or other external systems (e.g., Weights & Biases, LangSmith).
- **When**: Tracing occurs automatically during agent execution unless explicitly disabled via environment variables or configuration settings.

### Key Components of Tracing

#### 1. Traces
- **Definition**: A trace represents a single end-to-end workflow, encapsulating all operations performed during an agent’s execution (e.g., "Code generation" or "Customer service").
- **Properties**:
  - `workflow_name`: The logical name of the workflow (e.g., "Agent workflow").
  - `trace_id`: A unique identifier for the trace, auto-generated if not provided, in the format `trace_<32_alphanumeric>`.
  - `group_id`: Optional ID to link multiple traces (e.g., for a conversation thread).
  - `disabled`: Boolean to enable/disable trace recording.
  - `metadata`: Optional key-value pairs for additional trace information.
- **Purpose**: Traces provide a high-level view of the workflow, grouping related operations (spans) for analysis.

#### 2. Spans
- **Definition**: Spans are individual operations within a trace, each with a start and end time, capturing specific actions like LLM calls or tool executions.
- **Properties**:
  - `started_at` and `ended_at`: Timestamps marking the span’s duration.
  - `trace_id`: Links the span to its parent trace.
  - `parent_id`: Identifies the parent span (if any) for nested operations.
  - `span_data`: Contains operation-specific data (e.g., `AgentSpanData` for agent runs, `GenerationSpanData` for LLM calls).
- **Types of Spans**:
  - `agent_span()`: Wraps agent execution.
  - `generation_span()`: Captures LLM generation events.
  - `function_span()`: Tracks function/tool calls.
  - `guardrail_span()`: Monitors guardrail checks.
  - `handoff_span()`: Records handoffs between agents or systems.
  - `transcription_span()`: Handles speech-to-text processing.
  - `speech_span()`: Manages text-to-speech outputs.
  - `speech_group_span()`: Groups related audio spans.
  - `custom_span()`: Allows user-defined span tracking.
- **Purpose**: Spans provide granular insights into specific operations, enabling detailed debugging and performance analysis.

#### 3. Trace and Span Management
- **Context Management**: Traces and spans are managed using Python’s `contextvars` to track the current trace/span in concurrent environments.
- **Creation**:
  - Traces are created using the `trace()` function, ideally as a context manager (`with trace(...) as my_trace`).
  - Spans are automatically created by the SDK for default events or manually via functions like `custom_span()`.
- **Starting/Ending**:
  - Traces and spans can be started (`start()`) and finished (`finish()`) manually or via context managers.
  - The `mark_as_current` and `reset_current` parameters ensure proper tracking in concurrent workflows.
- **Disabling Tracing**:
  - Globally: Set environment variable `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`.
  - Per-run: Set `RunConfig.tracing_disabled = True`.
  - Note: Tracing is unavailable for organizations with Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policies.

#### 4. Sensitive Data Handling
- **What**: Certain spans (e.g., `generation_span()`, `function_span()`) may capture sensitive data like LLM inputs/outputs or function call parameters.
- **How**: Sensitive data capture can be disabled via:
  - `RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data`: Controls LLM and function call data capture.
  - `VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data`: Manages audio data (base64-encoded PCM) capture.
- **Why**: To ensure compliance with privacy requirements and avoid storing sensitive information.

#### 5. Custom Tracing Processors
- **What**: Custom trace processors allow developers to extend or replace the default tracing behavior, enabling integration with external systems (e.g., Weights & Biases, LangSmith).
- **How**:
  - **Add Processor**: Use `add_trace_processor()` to append a processor alongside the default one.
  - **Replace Processors**: Use `set_trace_processors()` to override default processors.
- **Architecture**:
  - A global `TraceProvider` creates and manages traces.
  - The `BatchTraceProcessor` sends traces/spans in batches to a `BackendSpanExporter` (default: OpenAI backend).
  - Custom processors implement the `TracingProcessor` interface, defining methods like `on_trace_start()`, `on_span_end()`, etc.
- **Supported External Processors**: Includes Weights & Biases, Arize-Phoenix, MLflow, LangSmith, and more.

### Example Code Analysis: Creating a Trace
```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")
    with trace("Joke workflow"): 
        first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Rating: {second_result.final_output}")
```

#### Line-by-Line Explanation
1. **Import Statements**:
   - `from agents import Agent, Runner, trace`: Imports the necessary classes and functions from the SDK.
   - **Why**: To access agent creation, execution, and tracing functionality.

2. **Agent Creation**:
   - `agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")`
   - **What**: Creates an agent named "Joke generator" with instructions to tell jokes.
   - **How**: The `Agent` class encapsulates the agent’s configuration.

3. **Trace Context Manager**:
   - `with trace("Joke workflow"):`
   - **What**: Creates a trace named "Joke workflow" to group subsequent operations.
   - **Why**: To track multiple `Runner.run()` calls as part of a single workflow.
   - **How**: The `trace()` function returns a `TraceImpl` object, and the context manager calls `start()` and `finish()` automatically.

4. **Agent Execution**:
   - `first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")`
   - **What**: Runs the agent with the input "Tell me a joke" and captures the result.
   - **How**: `Runner.run()` is wrapped in a trace, and operations (e.g., LLM calls) are tracked as spans (e.g., `agent_span`, `generation_span`).
   - **When**: Executed asynchronously within the trace context.

5. **Second Agent Execution**:
   - `second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")`
   - **What**: Runs the agent again to rate the previous joke.
   - **How**: Similar to the first call, tracked as part of the same trace.

6. **Output**:
   - `print(f"Joke: {first_result.final_output}")`
   - `print(f"Rating: {second_result.final_output}")`
   - **What**: Prints the joke and its rating.
   - **Why**: To display the agent’s outputs for user inspection.

#### Key Takeaways
- The `trace()` context manager ensures that both `Runner.run()` calls are grouped under a single trace, making it easier to analyze the workflow.
- Spans are automatically created for agent execution, LLM calls, etc., unless tracing is disabled.

### Summary
The OpenAI Agents SDK tracing system is a powerful tool for monitoring and debugging agent workflows. It organizes events into traces and spans, supports default and custom tracing, and integrates with external systems. The system is flexible, allowing developers to disable tracing, manage sensitive data, and extend functionality via custom processors. Understanding the lifecycle of traces and spans, along with their management via context variables, is crucial for effective use.
