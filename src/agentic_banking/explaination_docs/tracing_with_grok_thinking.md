## What is Tracing in the OpenAI Agents SDK?

Tracing is a mechanism to monitor and record the activities of an agent during its operation. Think of it as a detailed log or a "flight recorder" that captures every step—such as generating text with a language model (LLM), calling tools, or handling audio inputs—so you can debug, visualize, and optimize your agent’s behavior. The OpenAI Agents SDK provides built-in tracing, enabled by default, and offers a dashboard to view these traces during development or in production.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Event Logging**: Tracks LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrails, and custom events.
- **Default Enablement**: Tracing is on unless explicitly disabled.
- **Customization**: Allows custom traces, processors, and integration with external systems.

### Disabling Tracing
- **Globally**: Set the environment variable `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`.
- **Per Run**: Set `RunConfig.tracing_disabled = True`.
- **Zero Data Retention (ZDR)**: Tracing is unavailable for organizations under ZDR policies.

## Core Concepts: Traces and Spans

Tracing revolves around two primary entities: **traces** and **spans**.

### Traces
A **trace** represents a complete, end-to-end workflow or operation. It’s the big picture of what your agent is doing.

- **Properties**:
  - `workflow_name`: A descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Support Interaction").
  - `trace_id`: A unique identifier (e.g., `trace_abc123...`, 32 alphanumeric characters).
  - `group_id`: Optional, links related traces (e.g., a conversation thread).
  - `disabled`: If `True`, the trace isn’t recorded.
  - `metadata`: Optional key-value pairs for extra context.

- **Conceptual Scenario**: Imagine an agent handling a customer query. The trace might be named "Customer Support Interaction," capturing the entire process from receiving the question to delivering the answer.

### Spans
A **span** is a smaller, timed segment within a trace, representing a specific operation. Spans can nest within each other, forming a hierarchy.

- **Properties**:
  - `started_at` and `ended_at`: Timestamps marking the operation’s duration.
  - `trace_id`: Links the span to its parent trace.
  - `parent_id`: Identifies the parent span (if nested).
  - `span_data`: Details about the operation (e.g., LLM input/output).

- **Conceptual Scenario**: Within the "Customer Support Interaction" trace, spans might include:
  - `agent_span`: The agent’s overall processing.
  - `generation_span`: The LLM generating a response (nested under `agent_span`).
  - `function_span`: A tool call to fetch order status (also nested).

### Difference Between Traces and Spans
- **Trace**: The top-level container for a workflow (e.g., the entire customer interaction).
- **Span**: A specific, timed step within that workflow (e.g., generating the response).
- **Use**: Traces give the overview; spans provide granular details.

## Default Tracing

The SDK automatically wraps common operations in traces and spans, requiring no extra setup:

- **`Runner.run()`**: Wrapped in a `trace()` named "Agent workflow" by default.
- **Agent Runs**: Each run is a `agent_span()`.
- **LLM Generations**: Wrapped in `generation_span()`.
- **Tool Calls**: Wrapped in `function_span()`.
- **Guardrails**: Wrapped in `guardrail_span()`.
- **Handoffs**: Wrapped in `handoff_span()`.
- **Audio Processing**: Includes `transcription_span()` (speech-to-text), `speech_span()` (text-to-speech), and `speech_group_span()` for related audio.

- **Scenario**: An agent answers a spoken question:
  - Trace: "Agent workflow".
  - Spans: `transcription_span` (converting speech to text), `agent_span` (processing), `generation_span` (LLM response), `speech_span` (text-to-speech).

You can rename the default trace or tweak it via `RunConfig`.

---

## Custom Tracing

For more control, you can define your own traces and spans.

### Creating Traces
Use the `trace()` function to wrap a workflow:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")
    with trace("Joke workflow"):
        joke = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        rating = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {joke.final_output}")
        print(f"Joke: {joke.final_output}")
        print(f"Rating: {rating.final_output}")
```

- **Context Manager**: `with trace()` automatically starts and ends the trace.
- **Manual Control**: Call `trace.start()` and `trace.finish()` with `mark_as_current` and `reset_current` to manage concurrency.

- **Scenario**: A "Joke workflow" trace groups two agent runs: generating a joke and rating it.

### Creating Spans
Use functions like `custom_span()` for custom operations, though default spans usually suffice. Spans inherit the current trace and nest under the active span, tracked via Python’s `contextvars`.

## Code Breakdown

Let’s explore key files to understand the implementation.

### `trace.py` - Managing Traces

- **`Trace` (Abstract Base Class)**:
  - Defines the interface: `start()`, `finish()`, `trace_id`, `name`, etc.
  - Used by all trace implementations.

- **`NoOpTrace`**:
  - A "do-nothing" trace when tracing is disabled.
  - **Lines**: 
    - `start(mark_as_current)`: Sets it as current using `Scope` if requested.
    - `finish(reset_current)`: Resets the context.
  - **Use**: Ensures code runs without errors when tracing is off.

- **`TraceImpl`**:
  - The real trace implementation.
  - **Key Attributes**:
    - `_name`, `_trace_id`, `group_id`, `metadata`, `_processor`.
  - **Key Methods**:
    - `start()`: Marks as started, notifies the processor, sets as current if specified.
    - `finish()`: Notifies the processor, resets context if needed.
    - `__enter__`/`__exit__`: Context manager support.
  - **Line Example**:
    ```python
    self._processor.on_trace_start(self)  # Notifies processor of trace start
    ```
  - **Scenario**: A "Customer Support Interaction" trace starts, notifying the processor to log it.

- **Difference**: `NoOpTrace` vs. `TraceImpl`:
  - `NoOpTrace`: Placeholder, no recording.
  - `TraceImpl`: Full tracing with processor integration.

### `span.py` - Managing Spans

- **`Span` (Abstract Base Class)**:
  - Defines properties (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `span_data`) and methods (`start()`, `finish()`, `set_error()`).

- **`NoOpSpan`**:
  - Dummy span for disabled tracing.
  - **Lines**:
    - `start()`: Sets as current if requested, no real action.
    - `finish()`: Resets context if needed.

- **`SpanImpl`**:
  - Full span implementation.
  - **Key Attributes**:
    - `_trace_id`, `_span_id`, `_parent_id`, `_started_at`, `_ended_at`, `_processor`, `_span_data`.
  - **Key Methods**:
    - `start()`: Sets `started_at`, notifies processor.
    - `finish()`: Sets `ended_at`, notifies processor.
    - `set_error()`: Records errors (e.g., tool failure).
    - `export()`: Serializes span data.
  - **Line Example**:
    ```python
    self._processor.on_span_start(self)  # Logs span start
    ```

- **Scenario**: A `function_span` for a tool call fails, `set_error()` logs the issue.

- **Difference**: `NoOpSpan` vs. `SpanImpl`:
  - `NoOpSpan`: No-op placeholder.
  - `SpanImpl`: Tracks and logs operations.

### `scope.py` - Context Management

- Uses `contextvars` to track the current trace and span across threads or async calls.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `get_current_trace()`: Returns the active trace.
  - `set_current_span()`: Sets the active span, returns a token to reset later.
- **Scenario**: In a multi-turn chat, `Scope` ensures the correct trace is active for each message.

### `processor_interface.py` - Processing Traces and Spans

- **`TracingProcessor`**:
  - Abstract class with methods: `on_trace_start()`, `on_span_end()`, `shutdown()`, etc.
  - **Use**: Defines how traces/spans are handled (e.g., logged, exported).

- **`TracingExporter`**:
  - Exports traces/spans (e.g., to OpenAI’s backend).
  - **Difference**: Processor reacts to events; Exporter sends data elsewhere.

### `__init__.py` - SDK Integration

- **Functions**:
  - `add_trace_processor()`: Adds a processor for custom handling.
  - `set_trace_processors()`: Replaces default processors.
  - **Line Example**:
    ```python
    add_trace_processor(default_processor())  # Sets up default OpenAI backend logging
    ```
- **Use**: Configures tracing behavior globally.

---

## Sensitive Data Handling

- **LLM and Tool Data**: `generation_span()` and `function_span()` may capture sensitive inputs/outputs. Disable via `RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data`.
- **Audio Data**: Controlled by `VoicePipelineConfig.trace_include_sensitive_audio_data`.
- **Scenario**: A customer’s personal details in a query can be excluded from traces for privacy.

---

## Custom Processors and External Integration

- **Custom Processors**: Use `add_trace_processor()` or `set_trace_processors()` to send traces to systems like Weights & Biases or LangSmith.
- **Scenario**: Export traces to MLflow to analyze agent performance alongside ML experiments.

---

## Conceptual Scenarios

1. **Customer Support Agent**:
   - **Trace**: "Customer Support Interaction".
   - **Spans**: `transcription_span` (user’s speech), `agent_span` (processing), `function_span` (order lookup), `speech_span` (response).
   - **Nesting**: `function_span` under `agent_span`.
   - **Error**: Tool fails, logged in `function_span`.

2. **Multi-Turn Chat**:
   - **Traces**: Multiple "Chat Response" traces with the same `group_id`.
   - **Spans**: `generation_span` for each LLM call.
   - **Use**: View the conversation history in the dashboard.

## Conclusion

Tracing in the OpenAI Agents SDK provides a robust way to monitor and debug agents by capturing workflows (traces) and their operations (spans). Default tracing covers common tasks, while custom tracing offers flexibility. The system integrates processors and exporters for customization, handles sensitive data, and supports concurrency via `contextvars`. Understanding these components—traces vs. spans, NoOp vs. Impl, processors vs. exporters—equips you to build reliable, observable agents.
