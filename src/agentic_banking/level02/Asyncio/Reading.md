## Study Notes

### 1. Introduction to Async IO
- **Definition**: Asynchronous IO (async IO) is a language-agnostic concurrent programming paradigm that allows tasks to run concurrently by pausing and resuming execution, leveraging a single thread and single process.
- **Key Components in Python**:
  - **async/await**: Keywords introduced in Python 3.5 to define and manage coroutines.
  - **asyncio**: Python’s standard library package for running and managing asynchronous code.
  - **Coroutines**: Specialized generator functions at the heart of async IO, enabling non-blocking execution.
- **Async IO vs. Other Models**:
  - **Parallelism**: Executes multiple tasks simultaneously, often using multiprocessing (spreading tasks across CPU cores). Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations).
  - **Concurrency**: Allows multiple tasks to make progress in an overlapping manner. Async IO and threading are forms of concurrency.
  - **Threading**: Executes tasks in a single process with multiple threads, suited for IO-bound tasks (e.g., network requests). Limited by Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
  - **Async IO**: Single-threaded, single-process model using cooperative multitasking. Ideal for IO-bound tasks with long waiting periods (e.g., network or file IO).
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Async routines pause execution while waiting, allowing other tasks to run.
  - Facilitates concurrency without parallelism, using an event loop to manage tasks.

**Example (Chess Analogy)**:
- Synchronous: A chess master plays one game at a time (12 hours for 24 games).
- Asynchronous: The master moves between tables, making moves while opponents think (1 hour for 24 games).

---

### 2. Setting Up the Environment
- **Requirements**:
  - Python 3.7+ for full asyncio features (e.g., `asyncio.run()`).
  - Install libraries: `aiohttp` (async HTTP client/server), `aiofiles` (async file IO), optionally `aiodns`.
  - Use a virtual environment for dependency management:
    ```bash
    python3.7 -m venv ./py37async
    source ./py37async/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip aiohttp aiofiles
    ```

---

### 3. Core Concepts of Async IO
#### 3.1. Coroutines
- **Definition**: A coroutine is a function defined with `async def` that can suspend execution (using `await`) and pass control to another coroutine or the event loop.
- **Purpose**: Allows non-blocking execution, enabling other tasks to run during wait times.
- **Key Rules**:
  - **async def**: Defines a coroutine or asynchronous generator.
  - **await**: Suspends coroutine execution, passing control to the event loop until the awaited task completes.
  - **Coroutine Functions**: Can use `await`, `return`, or `yield`. Using `yield` creates an async generator (Python 3.6+).
  - **Restrictions**:
    - `await` is only valid inside `async def` functions.
    - `yield from` is not allowed in `async def` (raises `SyntaxError`).
    - Only awaitable objects (coroutines or objects with `__await__`) can be used with `await`.

**Example**:
```python
import asyncio

async def count():
    print("One")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Pauses for 1 second
    print("Two")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(count(), count(), count())

asyncio.run(main())  # Executes in ~1 second, not 3
```
- **Output**: All "One"s print first, then all "Two"s after ~1 second, showing concurrent execution.

---

#### 3.2. Event Loop
- **Definition**: A loop that monitors coroutines, schedules tasks, and resumes idle coroutines when their awaited results are available.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `asyncio.run(main())`: High-level function to run a coroutine, manage the event loop, and clean up (Python 3.7+).
  - `asyncio.get_event_loop()`: Retrieves the event loop for manual control (less common).
  - Example of manual event loop management:
    ```python
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
    finally:
        loop.close()
    ```
- **Properties**:
  - Runs in a single thread and CPU core by default.
  - Pluggable: Can use alternative implementations like `uvloop` (Cython-based, faster).
  - Coroutines must be scheduled on the event loop to execute (e.g., via `asyncio.run()` or `await`).

---

#### 3.3. Async/Await Syntax
- **async def**: Marks a function as a coroutine or async generator.
- **await**: Suspends the coroutine, yielding control to the event loop until the awaited task completes.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  async def g():
      r = await f()  # Pauses g() until f() completes
      return r
  ```
- **Precedence**: `await` has higher precedence than `yield`, reducing the need for parentheses compared to `yield from`.

---

### 4. Async IO Design Patterns
#### 4.1. Chaining Coroutines
- **Concept**: Coroutines can await other coroutines, forming a chain of dependent tasks.
- **Example** (`chained.py`):
  ```python
  async def part1(n):
      i = random.randint(0, 10)
      await asyncio.sleep(i)
      return f"result{n}-1"

  async def part2(n, arg):
      i = random.randint(0, 10)
      await asyncio.sleep(i)
      return f"result{n}-2 derived from {arg}"

  async def chain(n):
      p1 = await part1(n)
      p2 = await part2(n, p1)
      print(f"Chained result{n} => {p2}")

  async def main(*args):
      await asyncio.gather(*(chain(n) for n in args))

  asyncio.run(main(1, 2, 3))
  ```
- **Behavior**: Each chain runs concurrently, but within a chain, `part2` waits for `part1`. Total runtime is the maximum of individual chain runtimes.

---

#### 4.2. Using a Queue
- **Concept**: Producers add items to a queue, and consumers process them independently, enabling decoupled concurrency.
- **Example** (`asyncq.py`):
  ```python
  async def produce(name, q):
      for _ in range(random.randint(0, 10)):
          await randsleep(f"Producer {name}")
          item = await makeitem()
          await q.put((item, time.perf_counter()))

  async def consume(name, q):
      while True:
          await randsleep(f"Consumer {name}")
          item, t = await q.get()
          print(f"Consumer {name} got {item} in {time.perf_counter()-t:.5f} seconds")
          q.task_done()

  async def main(nprod, ncon):
      q = asyncio.Queue()
      producers = [asyncio.create_task(produce(n, q)) for n in range(nprod)]
      consumers = [asyncio.create_task(consume(n, q)) for n in range(ncon)]
      await asyncio.gather(*producers)
      await q.join()  # Wait for all items to be processed
      for c in consumers:
          c.cancel()
  ```
- **Key Points**:
  - `asyncio.Queue()` is thread-safe for async code.
  - `q.join()` ensures all items are processed before terminating consumers.
  - Consumers run indefinitely until cancelled, handling items as they appear.

---

### 5. Advanced Features
#### 5.1. Async Generators and Comprehensions
- **Async Generators** (Python 3.6+):
  - Defined with `async def` and `yield`, allowing iteration over async data.
  - Example:
    ```python
    async def mygen(u: int = 10):
        i = 0
        while i < u:
            yield 2 ** i
            i += 1
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    ```
- **Async Comprehensions**:
  - Use `async for` to iterate over async generators.
  - Example:
    ```python
    async def main():
        g = [i async for i in mygen()]
        return g
    g = asyncio.run(main())  # [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
    ```
- **Note**: Async generators/comprehensions allow pausing during iteration but do not inherently make iteration concurrent.

---

#### 5.2. Asynchronous Context Managers
- Use `async with` for resources that require async setup/teardown (e.g., `aiofiles.open()`).
- Requires `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods.
- Example:
  ```python
  async with aiofiles.open("file.txt", "a") as f:
      await f.write("data")
  ```

---

### 6. Practical Example: Asynchronous Web Crawler (`areq.py`)
- **Purpose**: Crawls URLs, extracts `href` links, and writes them to a file concurrently.
- **Key Components**:
  - **fetch_html**: Sends async GET requests using `aiohttp.ClientSession`.
  - **parse**: Extracts `href` links using regex and converts to absolute URLs.
  - **write_one**: Writes parsed links to a file using `aiofiles`.
  - **bulk SNIP
System: The document provided is a comprehensive guide to Async IO in Python, and I have structured the study notes to cover its key concepts systematically, from foundational to advanced topics. Below, I’ve included multiple-choice questions (MCQs) tailored for exam preparation, focusing on understanding and applying the concepts from the document.

## Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for Exam Preparation

### Basic Concepts
1. **What is the primary purpose of async IO in Python?**
   - A) To run multiple threads for parallel execution
   - B) To enable concurrent execution in a single thread
   - C) To distribute tasks across multiple CPU cores
   - D) To replace synchronous programming entirely
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: Async IO facilitates concurrency within a single thread and process using cooperative multitasking, not parallelism (which involves multiple threads or processes).

2. **Which Python version introduced the `async` and `await` keywords?**
   - A) Python 3.3
   - B) Python 3.4
   - C) Python 3.5
   - D) Python 3.6
   - **Answer**: C
   - **Explanation**: The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced in Python 3.5 to define and manage coroutines (PEP 492).

3. **What does the `await` keyword do in an async function?**
   - A) Pauses the function and waits for another thread to complete
   - B) Suspends the coroutine and passes control to the event loop
   - C) Creates a new event loop
   - D) Blocks the entire program until the task completes
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: `await` suspends the coroutine, allowing the event loop to run other tasks until the awaited coroutine completes.

4. **Which of the following is NOT a valid use of `async def`?**
   - A) Defining a coroutine that uses `await`
   - B) Defining a function that uses `yield from`
   - C) Defining an asynchronous generator
   - D) Defining a function with no `await` or `yield`
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: Using `yield from` in an `async def` function raises a `SyntaxError`. `async def` supports `await`, `return`, or `yield` for async generators.

---

### Intermediate Concepts
5. **What is the role of the event loop in asyncio?**
   - A) Manages multiple threads for parallel tasks
   - B) Schedules and resumes coroutines based on their readiness
   - C) Allocates CPU cores for multiprocessing
   - D) Executes synchronous functions concurrently
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: The event loop monitors coroutines, scheduling them to run when their awaited resources (e.g., IO operations) are ready.

6. **What happens if you call a coroutine without `await` or `asyncio.run()`?**
   - A) It executes immediately
   - B) It returns a coroutine object
   - C) It raises a `SyntaxError`
   - D) It blocks the program
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: Calling a coroutine directly returns a coroutine object, which must be awaited or scheduled on the event loop to execute.

7. **Which function is used to run a coroutine and manage the event loop in Python 3.7+?**
   - A) `asyncio.get_event_loop()`
   - B) `asyncio.run()`
   - C) `asyncio.create_task()`
   - D) `asyncio.gather()`
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: `asyncio.run()` is the high-level function to execute a coroutine, manage the event loop, and clean up afterward.

8. **What is the output order of the following code?**
   ```python
   async def count():
       print("One")
       await asyncio.sleep(1)
       print("Two")

   async def main():
       await asyncio.gather(count(), count(), count())

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```
   - A) One, Two, One, Two, One, Two
   - B) One, One, One, Two, Two, Two
   - C) Two, Two, Two, One, One, One
   - D) Random order
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: `asyncio.gather()` runs coroutines concurrently, so all "One"s print first, followed by all "Two"s after the 1-second sleep, demonstrating cooperative multitasking.

---

### Advanced Concepts
9. **In the `chained.py` example, what determines the total runtime of `main()`?**
   - A) The sum of all coroutine runtimes
   - B) The maximum runtime of any individual chain
   - C) The average runtime of all chains
   - D) The minimum runtime of any chain
   - **Answer**: B
   - **Explanation**: Since chains run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`, the total runtime is determined by the longest-running chain.

10. **In the `asyncq.py` example, why is `q.join()` used in `main()`?**
    - A) To create new consumer tasks
    - B) To wait for all queue items to be processed
    - C) To cancel producer tasks
    - D) To clear the queue
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: `q.join()` blocks until all items in the queue are processed (marked by `q.task_done()`), ensuring consumers finish before cancellation.

11. **What is the purpose of `async for` in asynchronous comprehensions?**
    - A) To enable concurrent iteration over a sequence
    - B) To iterate over an asynchronous generator
    - C) To parallelize loop execution
    - D) To replace synchronous `for` loops
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: `async for` iterates over async generators, allowing the coroutine to yield control to the event loop during iteration, but it does not make the iteration concurrent.

12. **In the `areq.py` web crawler, why is `aiohttp` used instead of `requests`?**
    - A) `requests` is slower for synchronous tasks
    - B) `requests` does not support awaitable coroutines
    - C) `aiohttp` is part of the standard library
    - D) `requests` cannot handle HTTP errors
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: `requests` uses blocking socket operations, incompatible with async IO, while `aiohttp` provides awaitable coroutines for non-blocking HTTP requests.

---

### Practical Application
13. **What is the purpose of `ClientSession` in the `areq.py` script?**
    - A) To limit the number of concurrent requests
    - B) To reuse connections for multiple requests
    - C) To parse HTML content
    - D) To write results to a file
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: `ClientSession` in `aiohttp` reuses connections (e.g., TCP connections) to improve performance for multiple HTTP requests.

14. **What happens if a URL in `areq.py` returns a 404 status?**
    - A) The script crashes
    - B) The error is logged, and an empty set is returned
    - C) The URL is retried automatically
    - D) The script skips all subsequent URLs
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: The `parse()` coroutine catches the `aiohttp.ClientError` (e.g., 404), logs the error, and returns an empty set of links, allowing the script to continue.

15. **Why is `async with` used in `areq.py` for file operations?**
    - A) To ensure synchronous file writing
    - B) To manage asynchronous file resources
    - C) To block other coroutines during writing
    - D) To parse URLs concurrently
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: `async with` is used with `aiofiles.open()` to manage async file resources, ensuring proper setup and cleanup without blocking other coroutines.

---

### Contextual Understanding
16. **When is async IO most suitable?**
    - A) For CPU-bound tasks like mathematical computations
    - B) For IO-bound tasks with significant wait times
    - C) For tasks requiring multiple CPU cores
    - D) For tasks with no dependencies
    - **Answer**: B
    - **Explanation**: Async IO excels in IO-bound tasks (e.g., network or file IO) where waiting periods can be used to run other tasks, unlike CPU-bound tasks suited for multiprocessing.

17. **What is a key advantage of async IO over threading?**
    - A) It supports more concurrent tasks
    - B) It uses multiple CPU cores
    - C) It avoids the GIL entirely
    - D) It simplifies memory management
    - **Answer**: A
    - **Explanation**: Async IO can handle thousands of concurrent tasks in a single thread, unlike threading, which is limited by system resources and GIL-related issues.

18. **Which asyncio function is used to wait for multiple coroutines to complete and return their results?**
    - A) `asyncio.run()`
    - B) `asyncio.create_task()`
    - C) `asyncio.gather()`
    - D) `asyncio.as_completed()`
    - **Answer**: C
    - **Explanation**: `asyncio.gather()` collects multiple coroutines into a single future, returning a list of their results when all complete.

These notes and MCQs cover the essential concepts from the document, organized to build understanding progressively and supplemented with clarifications for complex topics like coroutines and event loops. For further practice, you can run the example scripts (`countasync.py`, `chained.py`, `asyncq.py`, `areq.py`) to observe their behavior and experiment with modifications (e.g., adding more producers/consumers or URLs).
