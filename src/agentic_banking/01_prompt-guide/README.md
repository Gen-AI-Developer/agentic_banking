# The GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide 

The GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide is a comprehensive resource designed to help developers maximize the capabilities of the GPT-4.1 model family, particularly in the context of prompt engineering and building agentic workflows. This guide offers detailed best practices, examples, and strategic insights for effectively prompting GPT-4.1, especially when leveraging the OpenAI Agent SDK and related tools.

## Key Highlights of the GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide

### 1. Overview of GPT-4.1 Model Improvements

- GPT-4.1 improves significantly over GPT-4o in areas such as coding, instruction following, and handling long contexts.
- The model is trained to follow instructions more literally and closely, making it highly steerable through precise prompts.
- While many traditional best practices still apply (e.g., providing clear context and examples), prompt migration may be necessary to adapt to GPT-4.1’s more literal interpretation of instructions.
- A single clear sentence can often correct unexpected model behavior, emphasizing the importance of specificity in prompts.


### 2. Agentic Workflows with GPT-4.1

- GPT-4.1 excels at agentic workflows, which involve autonomous, multi-step problem-solving processes.
- The model was trained with diverse agentic problem-solving trajectories and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, solving 55% of problems.
- To fully utilize agentic capabilities, three types of system prompt reminders are recommended:

**Persistence:**
Ensures the model continues working on a problem until fully resolved, avoiding premature turn termination.
Example:

```
You are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
```

**Tool-calling:**
Encourages the model to use available tools to avoid hallucination or guessing.
Example:

```
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.
```

**Planning (Optional):**
Prompts the model to explicitly plan and reflect on tool calls rather than chaining calls silently, improving problem-solving quality.
Example:

```
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
```

- These instructions transform GPT-4.1 from a chatbot-like assistant into an autonomous, eager agent that drives interactions forward independently.


### 3. Tool Calls and API Usage

- GPT-4.1 has enhanced training for tool usage via the OpenAI API’s tools field.
- Developers are advised to pass tools exclusively through the API tools field rather than embedding tool descriptions manually in prompts, which reduces errors and keeps the model behavior consistent.
- Clear naming and detailed descriptions for tools and their parameters are crucial for proper usage.
- For complex tools, examples of usage should be included in a dedicated `# Examples` section within the system prompt, rather than in the tool description.
- The OpenAI Prompt Playground’s “Generate Anything” feature can help create effective tool definitions.


### 4. Prompting-Induced Planning and Chain-of-Thought

- GPT-4.1 is not inherently a reasoning model and does not internally generate a chain of thought.
- However, developers can induce explicit step-by-step planning and reflection in the prompt to simulate “thinking out loud.”
- Such induced planning has been shown to improve task success rates (e.g., a 4% increase in SWE-bench Verified pass rate).
- This approach helps the model to better organize problem-solving steps and reflect on outcomes between tool calls.


### 5. Sample Agentic Prompt for SWE-bench Verified

- The guide provides a detailed example prompt used to achieve high performance on the SWE-bench Verified coding benchmark.
- The prompt emphasizes thorough understanding, stepwise problem solving, iterative testing, and rigorous verification.
- Key workflow steps include:
    - Deeply understanding the problem before coding.
    - Investigating the codebase to gather context.
    - Developing a clear, incremental plan.
    - Making small, testable code changes.
    - Debugging to identify root causes.
    - Testing frequently after each change.
    - Iterating until the problem is fully solved.
    - Reflecting on the solution and writing additional tests to cover edge cases.
- The prompt instructs the agent to never end its turn until the problem is completely solved and all tests pass, including hidden tests.
- It also encourages extensive planning and reflection before and after each tool call to ensure insightful problem solving.


### 6. Python Tool Description for Stateful Execution

- The guide includes a description of a Python tool that executes code or terminal commands in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment without internet access.
- The tool supports a special `apply_patch` command to apply code diffs in a unique V4A diff format.
- This tool enables the agent to modify code, run tests, and debug iteratively within the task environment.

## Summary

The GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide is an essential manual for developers aiming to harness the advanced capabilities of GPT-4.1, especially for agentic workflows and coding tasks. It stresses the importance of:

- Clear, specific, and literal instructions.
- Persistence and autonomy in agent behavior.
- Effective use of API tools with proper naming and descriptions.
- Inducing explicit planning and reflection in prompts.
- Iterative, test-driven problem solving with rigorous verification.

By following this guide, developers can transform GPT-4.1 into a powerful autonomous agent capable of complex, multi-step tasks with high accuracy and reliability. The guide’s detailed examples and best practices make prompt engineering with GPT-4.1 a rewarding and productive experience, enabling users to enjoy learning and applying advanced prompting techniques effectively.
